## Introduction to R packages
.left[.footnote[Adapted from slides by Ali Varcarcel, presented on February 13th, 2020  
]]
---

## What is an R package?

A package is a suitable way to organize work for yourself and others

--

.pull-left[
A package is a bundled set of:

1. Functions
2. Documentation
3. Data
4. Vignettes
5. Versions
6. Dependencies
7. Tests and checks
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/hex.png")
```
]

--

Packages save you time, allow others to easily implement your methods, and make work more reproducible

---

## What are repositories?

A repository (a.k.a. repo) is a storage location from which software packages may be hosted for retrieval and installation on a computer.

The most popular repositories for R packages are:

--

1. [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the official repository for R and is a network of ftp and web servers maintained by the R community around the world.

--

2. [GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a web-based hosting service for version control, software development, and software management. Contributions can be of any language not just R.

--

3. [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) is a free and open source development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. Bioconductor is based primarily in R but does contain some contributions in other programming languages.

--

4. [Neuroconductor](https://neuroconductor.org/) is an open-source platform for rapid testing and dissemination of reproducible computational imaging software.

---

## Which repository to choose?

#### GitHub

Almost all modern packages are hosted on GitHub at least as a development version due to ease of use and version control capabilities

GitHub is completely user checked and tested so while the package may be hosted it could be broken

--
#### Bioconductor and Neuroconductor

Bioconductor and Neuroconductor have some checks and tests in order to host the package but they are more lenient than CRAN because they are field (genomic and imaging) specific

--

#### CRAN 

CRAN is the most strict repo and requires packages pass lots of checks and tests. CRAN also takes a lot of upkeep effort since any changes made to packages you depend will require you to update

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.mediumpage {
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

## Packages to Create R Packages

1. [`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis) is used for creating and developing packages

--

2. [`devtools`](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) is used for creating and developing, updating, checking, and testing packages

--

3. [`roxygen2`](https://github.com/yihui/roxygen2) is mainly for documenting the package you're creating

--

4. [`spelling`](https://github.com/ropensci/spelling) a package to check spelling in your package

--

5. [`todor`](https://github.com/dokato/todor) a package to find your `TODO`s, `FIXME`s, and other notes

--

6. [`testthat`](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) a package to help make unit tests

--

7. [`pkgdown`](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) a package to make documentation beautiful and online

--

8. [`available`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/available) is used to check if your package name is already taken

--

9. [`hexSticker`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) is used to create hex stickers for your package really easily

--

10. [`aliviateR`](https://github.com/avalcarcel9/aliviateR) is a wrapper around `devtools` and `usethis` functions to create a package quickly

## Making an R package from scratch
---

## What to make a package for
- Anything really
- As soon as you have one function for a new method, doesn't hurt to make a package


--

- A long time ago, I used to frequent a website that generated very useful images: https://calmingmanatee.com/, including ones like


--
![:scale 45%](https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sea-cow.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C432)
--
&nbsp; or	&nbsp; ![:scale 40%](https://sadanduseless.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/manatee3.jpg)
--

- But it's just a dead link now

---

## Introducing `motivateR`
- We're going to make a simple package that motivates you to be your best self
    - Including printing random motivational phrases
    - And telling you the score you deserve in life
--


- Through this minimal example, we will learn the following:

--
    - Creating and documenting functions
--
    - Including data in your R package
--
    - Unit tests
--
    - Building and checking your package
--
    - Continuous integration
--


- You can do this!

---

## Demo setup
- Packages used in this demo can be installed via

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("available", "usethis", "testthat",
                   "pkgdown", "roxygen2", "devtools",
                   "covr"))
```

- But feel free to install other packages that you find helpful, it's worth browsing through Ali's recommended packages
--


- The source for this slide set can be downloaded [here](Making-an-R-Package.Rmd) and placed in your package directory, but feel free to just copy paste code blocks too

---

## Checking name availability
.footnote[
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/available/versions/1.0.4
]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
available::available("motivateR")
```

```

## Creating the package
.footnote[
https://usethis.r-lib.org/
]

- `usethis::create_package` is a great way to start a new package using an R command
- RStudio also provides a great GUI for package creation via `File > New Project...`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package("~/Documents/GitHub/motivateR")
```
--

- Make sure to include a README!
```{r}
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```
---

## Setting up version control via Git
.footnote[
https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/
]

First, make sure to initialize Git in your package directory via

```{r}
usethis::use_git()
```
--

To connect your new repository with GitHub:
1. Go to GitHub and make a new repository with the name of your package
2. Don't make a `README.md` file
3. With your package directory as the working directory, run

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git remote add origin git@github.com:andrewac/motivateR.git
```

- Or use the GitHub Desktop app and go to `Add Existing Repository...` (I highly recommend this desktop app, by the way)
--


- Once this is done, RStudio provides a great interface to GitHub (will show you all later)
---

## Editing your `DESCRIPTION`
.footnote[
Documentation on version numbering: https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#version  
Some information about licenses: https://r-pkgs.org/license.html
]

```{txt, eval = FALSE}
Package: motivateR
Title: A Package Full of Motivation
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: When you have been coding for the past 8 hours straight, sometimes you need a little pick-me-up. motivateR is here for you.
License: Artistic-2.0
Encoding: UTF-8
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0)
LazyData: true
```

---

## Adding dependencies
.footnote[
https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/depends.html  
https://r-pkgs.org/description.html 
]

- No harm in doing this manually
    - `Depends:` dependency on a version of R and any package loaded using `library()`
    - `Imports:` other required packages
    - `Suggests:` suggested packages (for tests, vignettes, etc.)
--


- But there's also a `usethis` function for this, so why not use this:
```{r}
usethis::use_package("testthat", "Suggests")
```
---

## Editing your `NAMESPACE`
- Actually don't do this, `devtools` and `roxygen2` will handle this all for you automatically as you properly document your functions
- But it might look something like this

```{txt}
export("motivateR")

import("dplyr")
importFrom("stats", "lm", "var")
```

- The `NAMESPACE` specifies which packages/functions are imported and which functions your package exports (makes available to the user)
--



- Fun fact: even if you don't export the function, users can still access your internal functions via `:::`

---

## Adding a vignette
- All good R packages come with at least one vignette, otherwise how are people supposed to know how to use your package
--


- We won't actually fill out a vignette for this package, but here's the function to make one that you can edit later
```{r}
usethis::use_vignette("motivater", title = "How to get motivated")
```
---

## Including data with your package
.footnote[
https://r-pkgs.org/data.html
]

- Ever wonder why you can always type `mtcars` and magically have data

--
- R by default loads the `datasets` package, which has ton of datasets which you can check by running `data()`
--

- Can easily include an R object with your package via

```{r}
usethis::use_data(...)
```
--
- Best practice is to document how your dataset was created, so instead you should run
```{r}
usethis::use_data_raw(name = "manateequotes")
```
---

## What would a manatee say?
```{r}
## code to prepare `manateequotes` dataset goes here
manateequotes <- c("I'd hug you if I had arms",
                   "Everything will be OK",
                   "Hey, you got this",
                   "Keep your head up",
                   "Just take deep breaths, it's all right",
                   "You look great today!")

usethis::use_data(manateequotes)
```

- Feel free to add your own!
---

## Documenting data
.footnote[
https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data
]

- Don't forget to document your data, much like a function (see for example `?mtcars`)

```{r}
usethis::use_r("data")
```

```{r}
#' Things manatees tell you to lift your spirits
#'
#' A dataset containing several manatee quotes
#'
#' @format A character vector
#'
#' @source "Motivational manatee" Google image search
"manateequotes"
```
---
## Making your first function
- Just make a file in the `/R` directory, or

```{r}
usethis::use_r("motivate_me")
```

```{r}
motivate_me <- function(n = 1, score.me = TRUE, 
                        i.am.the.best = FALSE) {
  quote <- sample(manateequotes, n, replace = TRUE)
  if (i.am.the.best) {
    score <- 10
  } else {
    score <- 9 + round(rbeta(1, 5, 1), 1)
  }
  if (!score.me) {score <- NULL}
  sapply(quote, message)
  if (score.me) {
    message(paste("You deserve a", score))
  }
  score
}
```


---

## Don't forget the header!
- To tell `roxygen2` to automatically generate function documentation and `NAMESPACE` updates, insert a Roxygen skeleton via `Code > Insert Roxygen Skeleton`

```{r}
#' Title
#'
#' @param n 
#' @param score.me 
#' @param i.am.the.best 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
```
---

## Completed header for `motivate_me`
```{r}
#' Motivate me!
#'
#' @param n Number of motivational phrases
#' @param score.me TRUE if numbers make you feel warm and fuzzy.
#' @param i.am.the.best Are you the best?
#'
#' @return
#' @importFrom stats rbeta
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' motivate_me(5, score.me = TRUE)
#' motivate_me(50, score.me = TRUE, i.am.the.best = TRUE)
```
---

## Quick check
```{r}
motivate_me(n = 5)
```

```
Everything will be OK
Keep your head up
I'd hug you if I had arms
Hey, you got this
Everything will be OK
You deserve a 9.9
[1] 9.9
```

---

## Unit testing
- Code your own checks to make sure your functions work as intended
- Very useful to make sure your changes are not messing up necessary outputs
--

```{r}
# Initialize `testthat` package
usethis::use_testthat

usethis::use_test('do_i_deserve_a_10')
```

```{r}
test_that("i am the best and 10 is the number for me", {
  expect_equal(motivate_me(0, i.am.the.best = TRUE), 
               10)
})
```

--

- If your unit test fails, the package will not build
---

## And now you're done
- Actually though
--


- To make sure your `NAMESPACE` and documentation are updated, make sure to first run
```{r}
devtools::document()
```
--

- Then, press **Check** in the **Build** tab of RStudio
    - You'll probably get some notes, but no errors or warnings
    - In case of errors or warnings, carefully review the logs
--


- Any time you want to quickly test your package, use **Install and Restart**
    - Loads the package without having to build it for distribution
---

### Continuous integration via GitHub actions
.footnote[
https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/index.html  
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration  
https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/usethis-1-6-0/
]

- Automates a wide array of checks every time you push code to GitHub
    - Catch errors early, especially with multiple contributors
--


- From `usethis 1.6.0` release notes [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/usethis-1-6-0/):


- `use_github_action("check-standard")` (may have been replaced by `usethis::use_github_action_check_full()`) runs R CMD check on the latest R release on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and R-devel on macOS. This ensures that your package works on all major operating systems, and alerts you to any potential problems in the next version of R.
- `use_github_action("test-coverage")` uses covr to measure the test coverage of your package and publishes it to http://codecov.io/.
- `use_github_action("pkgdown")` uses pkgdown to build your package website and publishes it to the gh-pages branch.
---

## Package webpage with `pkgdown`
.footnote[
https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html  
If you get a invalid 'times' length error, make your terminal wider ([actually though](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1435))
]

- Automatically create your own package website, which can be readily hosted on a personal website ([GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) are free by the way)

```{r}
usethis::use_pkgdown()
pkgdown::build_site()
```

.center[![:scale 80%](figs/pkgdown_ex.png)]

## And that's all!
- Congratulations, **you did it!**
