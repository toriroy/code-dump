#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model to study the reproductive number
#' 
#' @description  Simulation of a basic SIR compartmental model with these compartments:
#'   Susceptibles (S), Infected/Infectious (I),
#'   Recovered and Immune (R).
#'   
#'   The model is assumed to be in units of months when run through the Shiny App.
#'   However as long as all parameters are chosen in the same units, 
#'   one can directly call the simulator assuming any time unit.
#'
#' @param S0 initial number of susceptible hosts
#' @param I0 initial number of infected hosts
#' @param f fraction of vaccinated individuals. Those individuals are moved from S to R at the beginning of the simulation
#' @param e efficacy of vaccine, given as fraction between 0 and 1
#' @param b level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment
#' @param g rate at which a person leaves the I compartment
#' @param w rate at which recovered persons loose immunity and return to susceptible state
#' @param m the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born)
#' @param n the rate of natural death (the inverse it the average lifespan)
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for your
#'   parameters
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
#'   result <- simulate_reproductivenumber()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
#'   result <- simulate_reproductivenumber(S0 = 2000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, g = 0.5, n = 0.1)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
#'   plot(result$ts[ , "Time"],result$ts[ , "S"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#'   # We might also want to have infectiousness rate for hosts in the I compartment
#'   # of 0.4.
#'   result <- simulate_reproductivenumber(S0 = 2000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, b = 0.4)
#'   plot(result$ts[,"Time"],result$ts[,"S"],xlab = "Time", ylab = "Number Susceptible",type="l")
#'   # We could also have infectiousness rate of 0.6 and recovery rate of 0.2.
#'   result <- simulate_reproductivenumber(S0 = 2000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, b = 0.6, g = 0.2)
#'   plot(result$ts[,"Time"],result$ts[,"S"],xlab = "Time", ylab = "Number Susceptible",type="l")
#' @seealso The UI of the shiny app 'ReproductiveNumber', which is part of this package, contains more details on the model.
#' @references See e.g. Keeling and Rohani 2008 for SIR models and the
#'   documentation for the deSolve package for details on ODE solvers
