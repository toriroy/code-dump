#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model including different control mechanisms
#'
#' @description  Simulation of a compartmental model with several different compartments:
#'   Susceptibles (S), Infected and Pre-symptomatic (P),
#'   Infected and Asymptomatic (A), Infected and Symptomatic (I),
#'   Recovered and Immune (R) and Dead (D).
#'   Also modeled is an environmental pathogen stage (E), and susceptible (Sv) and infected (Iv) vectors.
#'
#'   Any initial conditions not specified below start at 0.
#'
#' @param S0 initial number of susceptible hosts
#' @param I0 initial number of infected and symptomatic hosts
#' @param E0 initial amount of pathogen in environment
#' @param Sv0 initial number of susceptible vectors
#' @param Iv0 initial number of infected vectors
#' @param bP rate of transmission from pre-symptomatic to susceptible hosts
#' @param bA rate of transmission from asymptomatic to susceptible hosts
#' @param bI rate of transmission from symptomatic to susceptible hosts
#' @param bE rate of transmission from environment to susceptible hosts
#' @param bv rate of transmission from infected vectors to susceptible hosts
#' @param bh rate of transmission from symptomatic hosts to susceptible vectors
#' @param gP rate at which a person leaves the P compartment
#' @param gA rate at which a person leaves the A compartment
#' @param gI rate at which a person leaves the I compartment
#' @param pA rate of pathogen shedding into environment by asymptomatic hosts
#' @param pI rate of pathogen shedding into environment by symptomatic hosts
#' @param c rate of pathogen decay in environment 
#' @param f fraction of pre-symptomatic individuals that have an asymptomatic infection
#' @param d fraction of symptomatic infected hosts that die due to disease
#' @param w rate at which recovered persons lose immunity and return to susceptible state
#' @param mh the rate at which new hosts enter the model (are born)
#' @param nh the rate of natural death of hosts (the inverse it the average lifespan)
#' @param mv the rate at which new vectors enter the model (are born)
#' @param nv the rate of natural death of vectors (the inverse it the average lifespan)
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, in units of months
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. have I0 > PopSize or any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
#'   result <- simulate_idcontrol()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
#'   result <- simulate_idcontrol(S0 = 2000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, f = 0.1, d = 0.2)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
#'   plot(result$ts[ , "Time"], result$ts[ , "S"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#'   # Consider also a case where recoverd persons become susceptible again at a 
#'   # rate of 1.5.
#'   result <- simulate_idcontrol(S0 = 2000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, w = 1.5)
#'   plot(result$ts[,"Time"], result$ts[,"S"],xlab = "Time",ylab = "Number Susceptible",type="l")
#'   # Make death rate of natural hosts 0.5 and rate of pathogen decay 0.1.
#'   result <- simulate_idcontrol(S0 = 2000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, nh = 0.5, c = 0.1)
#'   plot(result$ts[,"Time"], result$ts[,"S"],xlab = "Time",ylab = "Number Susceptible",type="l")
#' @seealso The UI of the shiny app 'IDPatterns', which is part of this package, contains more details on the model
#' @references See e.g. Keeling and Rohani 2008 for SIR models and the
#'   documentation for the deSolve package for details on ODE solvers
