#' Simulation of an infectious disease transmission model with multiple compartments
#'
#' @description  Simulation of a compartmental model with several different compartments:
#' Susceptibles (S), Infected and Pre-symptomatic (P),
#' Infected and Asymptomatic (A), Infected and Symptomatic (I),
#' Recovered and Immune (R) and Dead (D)
#'
#' @param S0 specifies the initial number of susceptible hosts
#' @param P0 initial number of infected, pre-symptomatic hosts
#' @param bP level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the P compartment
#' @param bA level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the A compartment
#' @param bI level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment
#' @param gP rate at which a person leaves the P compartment, which
#'   is the inverse of the average time spent in that compartment
#' @param gA rate at which a person leaves the A compartment
#' @param gI rate at which a person leaves the A compartment
#' @param f fraction of pre-symptomatic individuals that have an asymptomatic infection
#' @param d fraction of symptomatic infected hosts that die due to disease
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for your
#'   parameters
#' @return The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#' with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#' is simulated as a set of ordinary differential equations.
#' @section Warning:
#' This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#' something nonsensical (e.g. have I0 > PopSize or any negative values or fractions > 1),
#' the code will likely abort with an error message
#' @examples
#' # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
#' result <- simulate_idcharacteristics()
#' # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
#' result <- simulate_idcharacteristics(S0 = 2000, P0 = 10, tmax = 100, f = 0.1, d = 0.2)
#' # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
#' plot(result$ts[,"Time"],result$ts[,"S"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' @references See e.g. Keeling and Rohani 2008 for SIR models and the
#'   documentation for the deSolve package for details on ODE solvers
